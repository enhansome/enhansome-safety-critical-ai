### <a id="what-is-a-critical-system"></a>What is a critical system?

Critical systems are systems whose failure can lead to injury 🤕, loss of life ☠️, environmental harm 🌱🚱, infrastructure damage 🏗️💥, or mission failure 🎯.

| **Application**                   | **Industry Vertical** | **Description**                       | **Failure Impact**                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Patient Monitoring**            | Healthcare            | Tracks vital signs                    | Failure can delay life-saving interventions |
| **Aircraft Navigation**           | Aerospace / Aviation  | Ensures safe flight paths             | Errors can lead to accidents                |
| **Power Grid Control**            | Energy                | Manages electricity distribution      | Failures can cause blackouts                |
| **Command & Control**             | Defence               | Coordinates military actions          | Failure risks national security             |
| **Industrial Automation Control** | Manufacturing         | Oversees production processes         | Malfunction can cause damage or injury      |
| **Core Banking System**           | Finance               | Handles transactions and account data | Downtime can affect financial operations    |

These systems are expected to operate with exceptionally high levels of safety, reliability and availability, often under *unclear* and *unpredictable* conditions.

They're the kind of systems we rarely think about... until something goes terribly wrong 🫣

**Critical systems don't forgive shortcuts**. Only engineering rigour stands between order and disaster.

> TL;DR Critical systems are built on trust - and trust is built on rock-solid engineering.

### AI in Critical Systems

So, where does that leave us? **Is there room for AI in critical systems?**

This isn't just a theoretical question - we're already well beyond the realm of hypotheticals.

From making life-or-death decisions in the ICU to controlling UAVs, performing surveillance and threat detection, and powering self-driving cars, intelligent systems aren't just emerging in these these domains - they're already fully operational.

Building these systems is no walk in the park. ML brings powerful capabilities, but also adds layers of complexity and risk that need to be addressed through careful engineering.

While its ability to learn patterns and make data-driven decisions is unmatched in some domains, the adoption of AI in high-stakes environments must be tempered with caution, transparency, and a sharp understanding of its limitations.

Let's briefly recap some of the most important...

#### 1. Models can and will make mistakes

<img src="assets/images/broken_dish.jpg" height="100px"  width="20%"/>

Better models may make fewer mistakes, but mistakes are generally *unavoidable*.

Mistakes are not a sign of poor engineering - they are an intrinsic feature of intelligence.

Working with AI means accepting this uncertainty and designing systems that can handle it gracefully.

#### 2. Mistakes can be strange and unpredictable

<img src="assets/images/jackie_chan_confused.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

AI doesn't always fail in ways that make sense to us.

It might [misclassify a stop sign with a sticker as a speed limit sign](https://spectrum.ieee.org/slight-street-sign-modifications-can-fool-machine-learning-algorithms) or [switch treatment recommendations based on the user's language](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2486372-typos-and-slang-spur-ai-to-discourage-seeking-medical-care/).

Unlike traditional software, which follows explicit rules, AI learns from data and generalises.

Generalization allows models to make predictions beyond what they've seen so far, but it's ultimately imperfect because the real world is messy, ever-changing, and rarely fits nicely into learned patterns.

#### 3. Model outputs are often probabilitic

Traditional software is predictable: identical inputs yield identical outputs.

In contrast, ML models, especially those involving deep learning, can break this rule and exhibit **probabilistic** behavior.

Their outputs are a function not only of the input features, but also of things like model architecture, learned weights, training data distribution, hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate, batch size), optimization methods, and more.

That said, inference is often **deterministic**. Once trained, most models are capable of producing consistent outputs for a given input, assuming fixed weights and no funky runtime randomness.

This determinism means that systematic errors and biases are reproducible - models will consistently make the same mistakes.

Moreover, models trained on similar datasets often converge to similar representations, leading to shared failure modes and blind spots. So while ML systems may appear dynamic and random, their behavior can be quite predictable.

#### 4. Data and models can change over time

<img src="assets/images/time_changes.jpg" height="100px"  width="20%"/>

Data and models are not static things. They'll evolve continuously due to changes in the environment, user behavior, hardware, regulations and more.

Imagine you're building a supervised learning system to [detect early signs of pneumonia in chest X-rays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

Over time, several factors can cause both the data and the model to evolve:

* **Data Drift:** the original training data may come from a specific hospital using a particular X-ray machine. As the system is deployed in new hospitals with different imaging equipment, patient demographics, or scanning protocols, the visual characteristics and quality of the X-ray images may vary significantly. This shift in the input distribution without an accompanying change in the task can reduce the model's diagnostic accuracy. This kind of drift doesn't actually crash the model, it just makes it *quietly wrong*.

* **Concept Drift:** clinical knowledge and medical understanding can also evolve. For instance, new variants of respiratory diseases may present differently on X-rays, or diagnostic criteria for pneumonia may be updated. The relationship between image features and the correct diagnosis changes, requiring updates to the labeling process and model retraining.

* **Model Updates:** the model is periodically retrained with new data to improve diagnostic performance or reduce false positives. These updates might involve changes in architecture, training objectives, or preprocessing steps. While performance may improve on average, these changes can introduce new failure modes and even regressions in certain edge cases. Model changes must be managed and monitored carefully, with rigorous testing and rollback plans.

* **External Factors:** regulatory changes or clinical guidelines may require the model to provide additional outputs, such as severity scores or explainability maps. This requires collecting new types of annotations and modifying the model's output structure.

In safety-critical domains like medical imaging, the evolution of data and models is inevitable. As such, systems must be designed with this in mind, embedding mechanisms for monitoring, validation, and traceability at every stage.

By proactively addressing data and model drift, automating model updates and defining processes for dealing with external influences, teams can ensure that AI systems remain not only accurate but also trustworthy, transparent, and robust over time.

#### 5. Zero-error performance is expensive and often impossible

<img src="assets/images/mirage.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

Here's an uncomfortable truth: **no AI system will ever be perfect**.

No matter how sophisticated your architecture, how clean your data, or how rigorous your testing - your system will eventually encounter scenarios it can't handle.

The pursuit of perfection isn't just futile; it's dangerous because it creates a false sense of security. Perfection is a mirage.

Instead of chasing the impossible, safety-critical AI demands a different mindset: **assume failure and design for it**.

This means embracing design principles that prioritize resilience, transparency, and human-centered control:

* **Graceful Degradation:** When AI fails - and it will - what happens next? Does the system shut down safely, fall back to simpler heuristics, or alert human operators? The difference between a minor incident and a catastrophe often lies in how elegantly a system handles its own limitations.

* **Human-AI Collaboration:** AI doesn't have to carry the entire burden. The most reliable critical systems often combine AI capabilities with human oversight, creating multiple layers of validation and intervention. Think of AI as a highly capable assistant, not an infallible decision-maker.

* **Monitoring and Circuit Breakers:** Just as electrical systems have circuit breakers to prevent dangerous overloads, AI systems need mechanisms to detect when they're operating outside their safe boundaries. Confidence thresholds, anomaly detection, and performance monitoring aren't nice-to-haves - they're essential safety features.

* **Failure Mode Analysis:** Traditional safety engineering asks `what could go wrong?` and designs accordingly. AI systems demand the same rigor. What happens when your model encounters adversarial inputs, when data quality degrades, or when edge cases compound in unexpected ways?

The goal isn't to eliminate failure - it's to make failure *safe*, *detectable*, and *recoverable*. This isn't just good engineering practice; it's an architectural requirement that separates safe systems from disasters waiting to happen.

> TL;DR When failure costs lives, AI must be engineered like a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.

#### The Bottom Line

<img src="assets/images/obstacle.jpg" height="100px" width="20%"/>

The challenges we've outlined aren't insurmountable obstacles; they're design constraints that demand respect, discipline, and *thoughtful* engineering. Each limitation - from unpredictable failures to shifting data landscapes - represents an opportunity to build more robust, transparent, and trustworthy systems.

The question isn't *whether* AI belongs in critical systems - it's already there, making life-and-death decisions every day. The real question is: **Are we developing these systems with the rigor they deserve?**

This collection exists because we believe the answer must be an emphatic **yes**. It's an open call to build AI systems that don't just perform well in the lab, but earn trust where it matters most.

In critical systems, **good enough isn't good enough**. The stakes are too high for anything less than our best engineering.
